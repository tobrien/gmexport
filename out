    chore: Update ESLint and Jest configurations
            •       ESLint configuration changes:
            •       Exclude fewer files from ESLint (tests/** and **/*.test.js are no longer globally ignored).
            •       Adjusted import/extensions rule to never enforce extensions for .js and .ts files but always enforce .d files.
            •       Jest configuration improvements:
            •       Enhanced code coverage thresholds:
            •       Branch coverage from 71% to 81%
            •       Function coverage from 88% to 89%
            •       Line and Statement coverage from 76% to 81%
            •       Added Jest configuration for improved test setup:
            •       Defined moduleDirectories, moduleFileExtensions, and moduleNameMapper.
            •       Specified testEnvironmentOptions, increased testTimeout, and set maxWorkers.
            •       Enabled diagnostic ignore codes for TypeScript.
            •       Removed unnecessary configurations (resolver: undefined).
            •       General cleanup:
            •       Removed unnecessary file (out).
            •       Deleted obsolete test and utility files (MessageWrapper.ts, config.ts, etc.).
            •       Dependency updates and build:
            •       Transitioned build tooling to use Vite for faster builds.
            •       Updated package.json scripts to align with new build system (vite build).
            •       Removed unused dependencies and updated existing ones for better stability and compatibility.
    
    This commit streamlines configurations, enhances testing robustness, improves build processes, and cleans up the codebase.

    feat: enforce import rules, improve test coverage, and refactor email export logic
    
    - ESLint:
      - Added `no-restricted-imports` rule to prevent relative imports within `src/**` and restrict imports from 'dayjs', 'fs', and 'moment-timezone'.
    
    - Jest:
      - Enhanced test coverage configuration to enforce higher thresholds (statements: 76%, branches: 71%, functions: 88%, lines: 76%).
      - Set explicit source paths for coverage collection.
      - Removed unnecessary resolver configuration.
    
    - Dependencies:
      - Added `moment-timezone`, `mockdate`, and corresponding types.
      - Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
    
    - Code Cleanup and Refactoring:
      - Deleted unused modules (`MessageWrapper.ts`, `config.ts`).
      - Refactored filename generation and filtering logic into more modular utilities.
      - Improved timezone handling, removed direct dependency on dayjs plugins in favor of centralized date utilities.
